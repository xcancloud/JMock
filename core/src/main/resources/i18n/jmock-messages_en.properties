jmock.func.data.tang.poetry=Zhang Jiuling\nTHOUGHTS I\nA lonely swan from the sea flies, \nTo alight on puddles it does not deign. \nNesting in the poplar of pearls \nIt spies and questions green birds twain: \n"Don't you fear the threat of slings, \nPerched on top of branches so high? \nNice clothes invite pointing fingers, \nHigh climbers god's good will defy. \nBird-hunters will crave me in vain, \nFor I roam the limitless sky.\n|Zhang Jiuling\nORCHID AND ORANGE I\nTender orchid-leaves in spring \nAnd cinnamon- blossoms bright in autumn \nAre as self- contained as life is, \nWhich conforms them to the seasons. \nYet why will you think that a forest-hermit, \nAllured by sweet winds and contented with beauty, \nWould no more ask to-be transplanted \nTHan Would any other natural flower? \n|Zhang Jiuling\nTHOUGHTS III\nThe hermit in his lone abode \nNurses his thoughts cleansed of care, \nThem he projects to the wild goose \nFor it to his distant Sovereign to bear. \nWho will be moved by the sincerity \nOf my vain day-and-night prayer? \nWhat comfort is for my loyalty \nWhen fliers and sinkers can compare? \n|Zhang Jiuling\nORCHID AND ORANGE II\nHere, south of the Yangzi, grows a red orangetree. \nAll winter long its leaves are green, \nNot because of a warmer soil, \nBut because its' nature is used to the cold. \nThough it might serve your honourable guests, \nYou leave it here, far below mountain and river. \nCircumstance governs destiny. \nCause and effect are an infinite cycle. \nYou plant your peach-trees and your plums, \nYou forget the shade from this other tree. \n|Li Bai\nDOWN ZHONGNAN MOUNTAIN \nTO THE KIND PILLOW AND BOWL OF HUSI\nDown the blue mountain in the evening, \nMoonlight was my homeward escort. \nLooking back, I saw my path \nLie in levels of deep shadow.... \nI was passing the farm-house of a friend, \nWhen his children called from a gate of thorn \nAnd led me twining through jade bamboos \nWhere green vines caught and held my clothes. \nAnd I was glad of a chance to rest \nAnd glad of a chance to drink with my friend.... \nWe sang to the tune of the wind in the pines; \nAnd we finished our songs as the stars went down, \nWhen, I being drunk and my friend more than happy, \nBetween us we forgot the world. \n|Li Bai\nDRINKING ALONE WITH THE MOON\nFrom a pot of wine among the flowers \nI drank alone. There was no one with me -- \nTill, raising my cup, I asked the bright moon \nTo bring me my shadow and make us three. \nAlas, the moon was unable to drink \nAnd my shadow tagged me vacantly; \nBut still for a while I had these friends \nTo cheer me through the end of spring.... \nI sang. The moon encouraged me. \nI danced. My shadow tumbled after. \nAs long as I knew, we were boon companions. \nAnd then I was drunk, and we lost one another. \n...Shall goodwill ever be secure? \nI watch the long road of the River of Stars. \n|Li Bai\nIN SPRING\nYour grasses up north are as blue as jade, \nOur mulberries here curve green-threaded branches; \nAnd at last you think of returning home, \nNow when my heart is almost broken.... \nO breeze of the spring, since I dare not know you, \nWhy part the silk curtains by my bed? \n|Du Fu\nA VIEW OF TAISHAN\nWhat shall I say of the Great Peak? -- \nThe ancient dukedoms are everywhere green, \nInspired and stirred by the breath of creation, \nWith the Twin Forces balancing day and night. \n...I bare my breast toward opening clouds, \nI strain my sight after birds flying home. \nWhen shall I reach the top and hold \nAll mountains in a single glance? \n|Du Fu\nTO MY RETIRED FRIEND WEI\nIt is almost as hard for friends to meet \nAs for the morning and evening stars. \nTonight then is a rare event, \nJoining, in the candlelight, \nTwo men who were young not long ago \nBut now are turning grey at the temples. \n...To find that half our friends are dead \nShocks us, burns our hearts with grief. \nWe little guessed it would be twenty years \nBefore I could visit you again. \nWhen I went away, you were still unmarried; \nBut now these boys and girls in a row \nAre very kind to their father's old friend. \nThey ask me where I have been on my journey; \nAnd then, when we have talked awhile, \nThey bring and show me wines and dishes, \nSpring chives cut in the night-rain \nAnd brown rice cooked freshly a special way. \n...My host proclaims it a festival, \nHe urges me to drink ten cups -- \nBut what ten cups could make me as drunk \nAs I always am with your love in my heart? \n...Tomorrow the mountains will separate us; \nAfter tomorrow-who can say? \n|Du Fu\nALONE IN HER BEAUTY\nWho is lovelier than she? \nYet she lives alone in an empty valley. \nShe tells me she came from a good family \nWhich is humbled now into the dust. \n...When trouble arose in the Kuan district, \nHer brothers and close kin were killed. \nWhat use were their high offices, \nNot even shielding their own lives? -- \nThe world has but scorn for adversity; \nHope goes out, like the light of a candle. \nHer husband, with a vagrant heart, \nSeeks a new face like a new piece of jade; \nAnd when morning-glories furl at night \nAnd mandarin-ducks lie side by side, \nAll he can see is the smile of the new love, \nWhile the old love weeps unheard. \nThe brook was pure in its mountain source, \nBut away from the mountain its waters darken. \n...Waiting for her maid to come from selling pearls \nFor straw to cover the roof again, \nShe picks a few flowers, no longer for her hair, \nAnd lets pine-needles fall through her fingers, \nAnd, forgetting her thin silk sleeve and the cold, \nShe leans in the sunset by a tall bamboo. \n|Du Fu\nSEEING Li Bai IN A DREAM I\nThere are sobs when death is the cause of parting; \nBut life has its partings again and again. \n...From the poisonous damps of the southern river \nYou had sent me not one sign from your exile -- \nTill you came to me last night in a dream, \nBecause I am always thinking of you. \nI wondered if it were really you, \nVenturing so long a journey. \nYou came to me through the green of a forest, \nYou disappeared by a shadowy fortress.... \nYet out of the midmost mesh of your snare, \nHow could you lift your wings and use them? \n...I woke, and the low moon's glimmer on a rafter \nSeemed to be your face, still floating in the air. \n...There were waters to cross, they were wild and tossing; \nIf you fell, there were dragons and rivermonsters. \n|Du Fu\nSEEING Li Bai IN A DREAM II\nThis cloud, that has drifted all day through the sky, \nMay, like a wanderer, never come back.... \nThree nights now I have dreamed of you -- \nAs tender, intimate and real as though I were awake. \nAnd then, abruptly rising to go, \nYou told me the perils of adventure \nBy river and lake-the storms, the wrecks, \nThe fears that are borne on a little boat; \nAnd, here in my doorway, you rubbed your white head \nAs if there were something puzzling you. \n...Our capital teems with officious people, \nWhile you are alone and helpless and poor. \nWho says that the heavenly net never fails? \nIt has brought you ill fortune, old as you are. \n...A thousand years' fame, ten thousand years' fame- \nWhat good, when you are dead and gone. \n|Wang Wei\nAT PARTING\nI dismount from my horse and I offer you wine, \nAnd I ask you where you are going and why. \nAnd you answer: "I am discontent \nAnd would rest at the foot of the southern mountain. \nSo give me leave and ask me no questions. \nWhite clouds pass there without end." \n|Wang Wei\nTO QIWU QIAN BOUND HOME\nAFTER FAILING IN AN EXAMINATION\nIn a happy reign there should be no hermits; \nThe wise and able should consult together.... \nSo you, a man of the eastern mountains, \nGave up your life of picking herbs \nAnd came all the way to the Gate of Gold -- \nBut you found your devotion unavailing. \n...To spend the Day of No Fire on one of the southern rivers, \nYou have mended your spring clothes here in these northern cities. \nI pour you the farewell wine as you set out from the capital -- \nSoon I shall be left behind here by my bosomfriend. \nIn your sail-boat of sweet cinnamon-wood \nYou will float again toward your own thatch door, \nLed along by distant trees \nTo a sunset shining on a far-away town. \n...What though your purpose happened to fail, \nDoubt not that some of us can hear high music. \n|Wang Wei\nA GREEN STREAM\nI have sailed the River of Yellow Flowers, \nBorne by the channel of a green stream, \nRounding ten thousand turns through the mountains \nOn a journey of less than thirty miles.... \nRapids hum over heaped rocks; \nBut where light grows dim in the thick pines, \nThe surface of an inlet sways with nut-horns \nAnd weeds are lush along the banks. \n...Down in my heart I have always been as pure \nAs this limpid water is.... \nOh, to remain on a broad flat rock \nAnd to cast a fishing-line forever! \n|Wang Wei\nA FARM-HOUSE ON THE WEI RIVER\nIn the slant of the sun on the country-side, \nCattle and sheep trail home along the lane; \nAnd a rugged old man in a thatch door \nLeans on a staff and thinks of his son, the herdboy. \nThere are whirring pheasants? full wheat-ears, \nSilk-worms asleep, pared mulberry-leaves. \nAnd the farmers, returning with hoes on their shoulders, \nHail one another familiarly. \n...No wonder I long for the simple life \nAnd am sighing the old song, Oh, to go Back Again! \n|Wang Wei\nTHE BEAUTIFUL XI SHI\nSince beauty is honoured all over the Empire, \nHow could Xi Shi remain humbly at home? -- \nWashing clothes at dawn by a southern lake -- \nAnd that evening a great lady in a palace of the north: \nLowly one day, no different from the others, \nThe next day exalted, everyone praising her. \nNo more would her own hands powder her face \nOr arrange on her shoulders a silken robe. \nAnd the more the King loved her, the lovelier she looked, \nBlinding him away from wisdom. \n...Girls who had once washed silk beside her \nWere kept at a distance from her chariot. \nAnd none of the girls in her neighbours' houses \nBy pursing their brows could copy her beauty. \n|Meng Haoran\nON CLIMBING ORCHID MOUNTAIN \nIN THE AUTUMN TO ZHANG\nOn a northern peak among white clouds \nYou have found your hermitage of peace; \nAnd now, as I climb this mountain to see you, \nHigh with the wildgeese flies my heart. \nThe quiet dusk might seem a little sad \nIf this autumn weather were not so brisk and clear; \nI look down at the river bank, with homeward-bound villagers \nResting on the sand till the ferry returns; \nThere are trees at the horizon like a row of grasses \nAnd against the river's rim an island like the moon \nI hope that you will come and meet me, bringing a basket of wine -- \nAnd we'll celebrate together the Mountain Holiday. \n|Meng Haoran\nIN SUMMER AT THE SOUTH PAVILION \nTHINKING OF XING\nThe mountain-light suddenly fails in the west, \nIn the east from the lake the slow moon rises. \nI loosen my hair to enjoy the evening coolness \nAnd open my window and lie down in peace. \nThe wind brings me odours of lotuses, \nAnd bamboo-leaves drip with a music of dew.... \nI would take up my lute and I would play, \nBut, alas, who here would understand? \nAnd so I think of you, old friend, \nO troubler of my midnight dreams ! \n|Meng Haoran\nAT THE MOUNTAIN-LODGE OF THE BUDDHIST PRIEST YE \nWAITING IN VAIN FOR MY FRIEND DING\nNow that the sun has set beyond the western range, \nValley after valley is shadowy and dim.... \nAnd now through pine-trees come the moon and the chill of evening, \nAnd my ears feel pure with the sound of wind and water \nNearly all the woodsmen have reached home, \nBirds have settled on their perches in the quiet mist.... \nAnd still -- because you promised -- I am waiting for you, waiting, \nPlaying lute under a wayside vine. \n|Wang Changling\nWITH MY BROTHER AT THE SOUTH STUDY \nTHINKING IN THE MOONLIGHT OF VICE-PREFECT \nCUI IN SHANYIN\nLying on a high seat in the south study, \nWe have lifted the curtain-and we see the rising moon \nBrighten with pure light the water and the grove \nAnd flow like a wave on our window and our door. \nIt will move through the cycle, full moon and then crescent again, \nCalmly, beyond our wisdom, altering new to old. \n...Our chosen one, our friend, is now by a limpid river -- \nSinging, perhaps, a plaintive eastern song. \nHe is far, far away from us, three hundred miles away. \nAnd yet a breath of orchids comes along the wind. \n|Qiu Wei\nAFTER MISSING THE RECLUSE \nON THE WESTERN MOUNTAIN\nTo your hermitage here on the top of the mountain \nI have climbed, without stopping, these ten miles. \nI have knocked at your door, and no one answered; \nI have peeped into your room, at your seat beside the table. \nPerhaps you are out riding in your canopied chair, \nOr fishing, more likely, in some autumn pool. \nSorry though I am to be missing you, \nYou have become my meditation -- \nThe beauty of your grasses, fresh with rain, \nAnd close beside your window the music of your pines. \nI take into my being all that I see and hear, \nSoothing my senses, quieting my heart; \nAnd though there be neither host nor guest, \nHave I not reasoned a visit complete? \n...After enough, I have gone down the mountain. \nWhy should I wait for you any longer? \n|Qiwu Qian\nA BOAT IN SPRING ON RUOYA LAKE\nThoughtful elation has no end: \nOnward I bear it to whatever come. \nAnd my boat and I, before the evening breeze \nPassing flowers, entering the lake, \nTurn at nightfall toward the western valley, \nWhere I watch the south star over the mountain \nAnd a mist that rises, hovering soft, \nAnd the low moon slanting through the trees; \nAnd I choose to put away from me every worldly matter \nAnd only to be an old man with a fishing-pole. \n|Chang Jian\nAT WANG CHANGLIN' S RETREAT\nHere, beside a clear deep lake, \nYou live accompanied by clouds; \nOr soft through the pine the moon arrives \nTo be your own pure-hearted friend. \nYou rest under thatch in the shadow of your flowers, \nYour dewy herbs flourish in their bed of moss. \nLet me leave the world. Let me alight, like you, \nOn your western mountain with phoenixes and cranes. \n|Cen Can\nASCENDING THE PAGODA AT THE TEMPLE OF KIND \nFAVOUR WITH GAO SHI AND XUE JU\nThe pagoda, rising abruptly from earth, \nReaches to the very Palace of Heaven.... \nClimbing, we seem to have left the world behind us, \nWith the steps we look down on hung from space. \nIt overtops a holy land \nAnd can only have been built by toil of the spirit. \nIts four sides darken the bright sun, \nIts seven stories cut the grey clouds; \nBirds fly down beyond our sight, \nAnd the rapid wind below our hearing; \nMountain-ranges, toward the east, \nAppear to be curving and flowing like rivers; \nFar green locust-trees line broad roads \nToward clustered palaces and mansions; \nColours of autumn, out of the west, \nEnter advancing through the city; \nAnd northward there lie, in five graveyards, \nCalm forever under dewy green grass, \nThose who know life's final meaning \nWhich all humankind must learn. \n...Henceforth I put my official hat aside. \nTo find the Eternal Way is the only happiness. \n|Yuan Jie\nTO THE TAX-COLLECTORS \nAFTER THE BANDITS RETREAT\nIn the year Kuimao the bandits from Xiyuan entered Daozhou, set fire, raided, killed, and looted. The whole district was almost ruined. The next year the bandits came again and, attacking the neighbouring prefecture, Yong, passed this one by. It was not because we were strong enough to defend ourselves, but, probably, because they pitied us. And how now can these commissioners bear to impose extra taxes? I have written this poem for the collectors' information. \nI still remember those days of peace -- \nTwenty years among mountains and forests, \nThe pure stream running past my yard, \nThe caves and valleys at my door. \nTaxes were light and regular then, \nAnd I could sleep soundly and late in the morning- \nTill suddenly came a sorry change. \n...For years now I have been serving in the army. \nWhen I began here as an official, \nThe mountain bandits were rising again; \nBut the town was so small it was spared by the thieves, \nAnd the people so poor and so pitiable \nThat all other districts were looted \nAnd this one this time let alone. \n...Do you imperial commissioners \nMean to be less kind than bandits? \nThe people you force to pay the poll \nAre like creatures frying over a fire. \nAnd how can you sacrifice human lives, \nJust to be known as able collectors? -- \n...Oh, let me fling down my official seal, \nLet me be a lone fisherman in a small boat \nAnd support my family on fish and wheat \nAnd content my old age with rivers and lakes! \n|Wei Yingwu\nENTERTAINING LITERARY MEN IN MY \nOFFICIAL RESIDENCE ON A RAINY DAY\nOutside are insignia, shown in state; \nBut here are sweet incense-clouds, quietly ours. \nWind and rain, coming in from sea, \nHave cooled this pavilion above the lake \nAnd driven the feverish heat away \nFrom where my eminent guests are gathered. \n...Ashamed though I am of my high position \nWhile people lead unhappy lives, \nLet us reasonably banish care \nAnd just be friends, enjoying nature. \nThough we have to go without fish and meat, \nThere are fruits and vegetables aplenty. \n...We bow, we take our cups of wine, \nWe give our attention to beautiful poems. \nWhen the mind is exalted, the body is lightened \nAnd feels as if it could float in the wind. \n...Suzhou is famed as a centre of letters; \nAnd all you writers, coming here, \nProve that the name of a great land \nIs made by better things than wealth. \n|Wei Yingwu\nSETTING SAIL ON THE YANGZI \nTO SECRETARY YUAN\nWistful, away from my friends and kin, \nThrough mist and fog I float and float \nWith the sail that bears me toward Loyang. \nIn Yangzhou trees linger bell-notes of evening, \nMarking the day and the place of our parting.... \nWhen shall we meet again and where? \n...Destiny is a boat on the waves, \nBorne to and fro, beyond our will. \n|Wei Yingwu\nA POEM TO A TAOIST HERMIT \nCHUANJIAO MOUNTAIN\nMy office has grown cold today; \nAnd I suddenly think of my mountain friend \nGathering firewood down in the valley \nOr boiling white stones for potatoes in his hut.... \nI wish I might take him a cup of wine \nTo cheer him through the evening storm; \nBut in fallen leaves that have heaped the bare slopes, \nHow should I ever find his footprints! \n|Wei Yingwu\nON MEETING MY FRIEND FENG ZHU \nIN THE CAPITAL\nOut of the east you visit me, \nWith the rain of Baling still on your clothes, \nI ask you what you have come here for; \nYou say: "To buy an ax for cutting wood in the mountains" \n...Hidden deep in a haze of blossom, \nSwallow fledglings chirp at ease \nAs they did when we parted, a year ago.... \nHow grey our temples have grown since them! \n|Wei Yingwu\nMOORING AT TWILIGHT IN YUYI DISTRICT\nFurling my sail near the town of Huai, \nI find for harbour a little cove \nWhere a sudden breeze whips up the waves. \nThe sun is growing dim now and sinks in the dusk. \nPeople are coming home. The bright mountain-peak darkens. \nWildgeese fly down to an island of white weeds. \n...At midnight I think of a northern city-gate, \nAnd I hear a bell tolling between me and sleep. \n|Wei Yingwu\nEAST OF THE TOWN\nFrom office confinement all year long, \nI have come out of town to be free this morning \nWhere willows harmonize the wind \nAnd green hills lighten the cares of the world. \nI lean by a tree and rest myself \nOr wander up and down a stream. \n...Mists have wet the fragrant meadows; \nA spring dove calls from some hidden place. \n...With quiet surroundings, the mind is at peace, \nBut beset with affairs, it grows restless again.... \nHere I shall finally build me a cabin, \nAs Tao Qian built one long ago. \n|Wei Yingwu\nTO MY DAUGHTER \nON HER MARRIAGE INTO THE YANG FAMILY\nMy heart has been heavy all day long \nBecause you have so far to go. \nThe marriage of a girl, away from her parents, \nIs the launching of a little boat on a great river. \n...You were very young when your mother died, \nWhich made me the more tender of you. \nYour elder sister has looked out for you, \nAnd now you are both crying and cannot part. \nThis makes my grief the harder to bear; \nYet it is right that you should go. \n...Having had from childhood no mother to guide you, \nHow will you honour your mother-in-law? \nIt's an excellent family; they will be kind to you, \nThey will forgive you your mistakes -- \nAlthough ours has been so pure and poor \nThat you can take them no great dowry. \nBe gentle and respectful, as a woman should be, \nCareful of word and look, observant of good example. \n...After this morning we separate, \nThere's no knowing for how long.... \nI always try to hide my feelings -- \nThey are suddenly too much for me, \nWhen I turn and see my younger daughter \nWith the tears running down her cheek. \n|Liu Zongyuan\nREADING BUDDHIST CLASSICS WITH ZHAO \nAT HIS TEMPLE IN THE EARLY MORNING\nI clean my teeth in water drawn from a cold well; \nAnd while I brush my clothes, I purify my mind; \nThen, slowly turning pages in the Tree-Leaf Book, \nI recite, along the path to the eastern shelter. \n...The world has forgotten the true fountain of this teaching \nAnd people enslave themselves to miracles and fables. \nUnder the given words I want the essential meaning, \nI look for the simplest way to sow and reap my nature. \nHere in the quiet of the priest's templecourtyard, \nMosses add their climbing colour to the thick bamboo; \nAnd now comes the sun, out of mist and fog, \nAnd pines that seem to be new-bathed; \nAnd everything is gone from me, speech goes, and reading, \nLeaving the single unison. \n|Liu Zongyuan\nDWELLING BY A STREAM\nI had so long been troubled by official hat and robe \nThat I am glad to be an exile here in this wild southland. \nI am a neighbour now of planters and reapers. \nI am a guest of the mountains and woods. \nI plough in the morning, turning dewy grasses, \nAnd at evening tie my fisher-boat, breaking the quiet stream. \nBack and forth I go, scarcely meeting anyone, \nAnd sing a long poem and gaze at the blue sky. \n|Wang Changling\nAT A BORDER-FORTRESS\nCicadas complain of thin mulberry-trees \nIn the Eighth-month chill at the frontier pass. \nThrough the gate and back again, all along the road, \nThere is nothing anywhere but yellow reeds and grasses \nAnd the bones of soldiers from You and from Bing \nWho have buried their lives in the dusty sand. \n...Let never a cavalier stir you to envy \nWith boasts of his horse and his horsemanship |\nWang Changling\nUNDER A BORDER-FORTRESS\nDrink, my horse, while we cross the autumn water!- \nThe stream is cold and the wind like a sword, \nAs we watch against the sunset on the sandy plain, \nFar, far away, shadowy Lingtao. \nOld battles, waged by those long walls, \nOnce were proud on all men's tongues. \nBut antiquity now is a yellow dust, \nConfusing in the grasses its ruins and white bones.

If the affection is deep, I am not afraid of the long-term, having you in my heart is enough to comfort a lonely soul. The cymbals were pale that day, the white dew was frost, and the autumn breeze brought coolness. Xia came quietly, and went quietly. The autumn models came with graceful and graceful steps, lovingly sending the back of Xia Yuan, accompanied by fallen leaves, waiting for the arrival of the next season. Looking at the withered leaves, knowing that some departures are unobstructed, and the empty heart will be filled with the tranquility of the autumn light, so the parting time and time will be warmed by the next meeting. Accidentally met and met. You are over there. I am here. A virtual thread connects us together. We could have become friends, communicate, talk, and sigh. However, we have been indulged in real life for too long. In this masked society, we have lost the most precious and simplest relationship between people-trust!
The world is changing at an unprecedented pace. Technology has transformed how we communicate, work, and live. As we navigate this digital age, it's crucial to maintain our human connections and values. Nature has a way of healing and inspiring us.

The soul is the most beautiful, and it can bring out the beauty of people more than every kind of cosmetics and every kind of jewelry in the world. Therefore, we must pay attention to this "heart". Only by having a beautiful heart can it be regarded as true "beauty". As the saying goes, "Although beautiful, but without a pure soul, it is like a bright glass eye that does not discern the world.|like a journey. When you get on a train, no one knows the destination. But in the middle of the process, there will be many people getting in and out of the car back and forth. Among these people, there are relatives and friends of their own, and of course, there are strangers.

It is like an abyss. From the moment you jump down, you must work hard. Either the Dapeng spreads its wings and soars upward; or, Shi Shenyuandi, there is no sound anymore.

Perhaps, it is precisely because it cannot be retained that people make the general sigh of "time does not wait for me"; perhaps, it is precisely because of the constant passing of time that people express the perception that "time is money"; perhaps, it is time that makes People have a lot of past events, so that people deeply understand the regret of "the old man is sad"; perhaps, it is time for us to experience everything, and we understand that cherishing time is cherishing life, and the journey of life should take the boat of time together.

There is another kind of filial piety, that is, giving home to the elders. Everyone, there are many people like this in history. In the past, people said that loyalty and filial piety are difficult to achieve. Actual loyalty is the greatest filial piety. For us, if we want to be filial, we must first master scientific and cultural knowledge. There are many ways of filial piety, and everyone may have their own methods.

As the Austrian philosopher Boile Lloyd said: "Life is like playing chess, as long as you don't make a mistake, you will lose everything."

A good grasp of this period will lay the foundation for your entire life. Time is merciless to anyone, but it is also the most fair. It will not favor anyone for no reason. As long as we are not paying attention, time will disappear silently, and a beautiful scenery will be missed. As long as we cherish time and be a race against time, time will slow down at our speed; as long as we keep working hard, success will wave to us, even if we fail sometimes, we can say frankly: "We work hard After that, we have no regrets or regrets!"|Qingqiu, I leaned over and picked up the red leaves that fell on the ground.

There are a lot of fallen leaves in spring.

But this means that you have enough inner strength and surplus spiritual activities, you can open up at any time, and flow out at any time, like a spring in a mountain, flowing to the groove of sympathy that can accommodate you; sometimes you have to take risks, and you have to spend money , You have to fight between the rocks and the thorny grass to find your way patiently. At that time, it was difficult, painful, and exhausted, and it was possible in you, as flexible as water, and as soft as water.

When we look back on all this, we can't help feeling very much. I am a kid who doesn't cherish time, but from reading Zhu Ziqing's "Hurry", I realized that only by cherishing every minute of your time can you become the master of time, not the slave of time. I think that I will listen to the lectures carefully during class so that I can make full use of the 40 minutes of each session; after school, I will finish my homework carefully and then speed up the action!

Indeed, the time that has gone forever is like a river, day and night, but this is not something that everyone can feel. Among those who can feel it, not everyone can make a change in their current life. In reality, there is always such a phenomenon: people will inadvertently feel the passing of time, but the days always pass in a daze. This is a living example of knowing the rush of time, but having no choice but to fly by. Or, people will always push what should be done today to do it tomorrow. But: "Tomorrow and tomorrow, how many tomorrows. I am born to be tomorrow, everything will come to nothing. Ah! It's dark, and there will be a brighter time, but is that the light of the past? Spring is over, the four seasons are reincarnation, there are recurrences Every now and then, is that the spring of yesterday? The time is gone forever. "Why do you have to go this way for nothing?

After all, there cannot be two identical leaves in the world, and humans are no exception. It is impossible for two people with exactly the same personality to become friends, just like looking in a mirror. On the contrary, those who can become long-term friends must be people with complementary personalities. One movement and one silence are permanent. Personality is not very similar, so it will inevitably lead to differences in outlook on life, values \u200B\u200Band world outlook.

No matter how gorgeous Tsing Yi is, in a scene, it is destined to be out of date. Youth is originally a hasty drama. In and out of the drama, too many mysteries that cannot be guessed have been brewed|You are the cause that I planted, and whose retribution I am. There are so many sceneries in the world. In many cases, we cannot tell who is the cup of tea you want and who is your home in the vicissitudes of life. Some people look good, but they can't take up the storm with you; some people look like prodigal sons, but they are your true returnees. And all of this, when you encounter life's hurdles, you will know it for yourself|The heart has two petals, one is eternal, and the other is memory; love is divided into two places, one is treasured, and the other is aftertaste. A name, a few strokes; a word of love, three times; a clear dream, deep and shallow. It is drunk. It is joy. It is resentment. It is hate. It is unwilling. It is not important. I only wish: if you are well, it will be sunny; if you are happy, it is the end|A long time ago, we passed by countless times. From now on, I will never miss the opportunity to hold hands with you.

He treats you kindly and regards you as the most important one in life|You have to learn to weigh the pros and cons, learn to give up something, and then you can get something|The best time is when a person sits somewhere quietly reading a book. Just like the most wonderful loneliness, it is sitting on a bench on the street without waiting for anyone|Don't want to keep the momentary beauty forever, as long as you have it, it is enough. Let the once possessed become the eternal body scent, make the once possessed a mirror to cherish the present, and make the once possessed become the source of our confident self-confidence|The north of the bridge is rainy and the spring is aquatic, and the south of the bridge is sunset and the mountains are horizontal. Ask you unhappy with wine? Listen to the sound of Linggeyan|The red dust has dreams, the years are blurred, idle words and sorrows are embarrassing, and the fragrance is broken for an instant, only to be sad, and there is no embrace, and the affection that is stained on the clothes is confined; The fleeting years; the rouge stained with ashes, the flower soul is buried, the sword is folded and the blade is broken, and the pride is broken; the love has thousands of knots, turned into a paper crane, whose thoughts are sent? Hate has a faint sorrow, turns into a blue light, and understands who's Bodhi thoroughly|Sitting on the window sill, looking into the distance, the sky is misty, and the darkness is about to come. I just felt so distressed that I couldn't get any more. I closed my eyes and forced myself to sleep. My throat was dry and uncomfortable, and my mood was extremely depressed|There is love in life, so I am always willing to give myself selflessly for some small touches. Life is ruthless. I want to have a pure love in a simple time, but things always go against my wish. Thousands of sails are exhausted, just looking for a small boat and letting things go. Reading countless people, I only wish to find a confidant in the dream|Once upon a time, I liked to collect those old items. Will cherish a thread-bound book, will be obsessed with a classic opera, will fall in love with a piece of warm old jade. I'm always afraid that I will lose them when I don't expect it, and I will never see them in this life. I am afraid that I will be caught by Lulu Hongchen and forget all the beauty of the past. But I don't know that time, this sharp carving knife, has already carved everything, whether you like it or not, the ones that have existed will never be wiped away|A sad and affectionate ballad disturbed the mood for several days in late spring. The heavy pen and ink continues the sorrow of the lyrics, the eyes are wide, the heart is sad, and the tears flow. On every lonely night, Wang Hui becomes a deep pool on the soft pillow|The years are like water, and the years are like smoke. Seeing all the flowers blooming throughout the four seasons, who is more fragrant than who, and who is sweeter than who|I want to be in the wavy red leaves, full of charm and gentleness, dance a neon feathers, and fall drunk in your arms|Meeting under the forest, regardless of cause and effect. Running through the bustling crowd, you will suddenly find that those who have agreed to join hands with the end of the world have parted ways early. Is there a real promise not to be changed in this world? Even between the mountains and the water, between the sky and the earth, there will be a day of disgust and weary heart. Therefore, be indifferent to your character and set your own destiny. In this way, it is really simple|I am Tsing Yi, and my destiny is the chess played by others. Therefore, the meeting between you and me can only be in the play. After singing the peach blossom fan and singing the jade hairpin, it seems like time is a simple reincarnation. I always thought that if the actor's makeup was gone, it was enough, and people were as pale as a chrysanthemum. Unexpectedly, it caused lovesickness like rain, and a dream became an illness. One day, the story in the play came to an end. At that time, I couldn't even give you an ordinary snuggle|Some people say that when people who love each other stay together, even the time is beautiful. I want to say this to the person who must have loved, and only after loving can you deeply understand the sweetness of having and being owned. As if the mountains and rivers have emotions, every inch of skin can be stretched under the breeze and bright moon. When you love, you will find that you are the happiest person. The rough clothes and plain cloth are also beautiful, and the light rice and tea are also warm|My horse's hoof is a beautiful mistake. I'm just passing by, not returning|The past cannot be rewritten, but it makes me stronger. Thank you for every change, every heartbreak, every scar|Spring is here, when the wind blows, quietly listening, like a group of young girls talking, shaking the tree, shaking the land, stepping on the ice, as if saying, tree, wake up, dial Open your buds, it's spring, let the flowers bloom, quickly show your demeanor, let people even appreciate your beauty, the grass will show your long hair and smiling face, the sunshine is waiting for you to go to the end of the world|The best relationship is that you can be yourself completely, and your significant other is still obsessed with the real you|The rain fell from the corner of the eaves, and the wind passed through the window. On such a day, it is suitable for leaning on the building to listen to the opera, enjoying the lotus by the pond, leaving a three-point smile between the eyebrows, and hiding seven points of cold arrogance under the eyes. The bustling city was shut out for granted, and the drizzle and smoke remained in my heart. So peaceful, even if it goes to the point where no one cares about it, I don't feel lonely|How many times have I looked back lightly, without you, the silent openness pierced my eyes|The years are long and the time is short.

Four sighs that the peach blossoms are cold in their dreams, and the blue light is burning for a few nights|Time is like water, things change and stars move, many people and things go their separate ways, and their whereabouts are unknown. And fate is a magical river. We floated in it with oars and drove in our respective directions. In the future where there is no agreement, one day they will meet unexpectedly. It's like a past, an old opera, an old book. Infiltrated by the fireworks of the five flavors, washed by the joys and sorrows of the world, there is still the tranquility of the desolate amidst the desolation|Occasionally I miss my childhood, I don't know how to feel sad, I don't have to bear blame, I won't be heartbroken for others, and I don't know the suffering in the world|Keep your mouth in the group, keep your heart alone.

I am not alone|When you are alone, you may be irritable. Don't forget to control your emotions. Don't hurt important people for your emotions|Booming red dust, cold smoke on the Mo.

There is a lot of time to waste, and not to worry about the passing years and the turning of the head in the blink of an eye. It's just that in this world, how many people can be sober and self-sustaining, dare to bear the consumption brought by time, dare to accept the hasty changes brought about by fate|The world is fleeting, full of vanity, who remembers the pale oath when he was young|The world is vast and thousands of years have passed.

There are so many unintelligible mysteries in destiny, so we can't control ourselves so much. It is said that life is like a drama, but why, at the beginning, the ending of others is always directed.

You see, you are still the Tsing Yi in the play, under the flowers, interpreting the beauty of death with your soul|Away from the hustle and bustle of the city and return to the hometown, just want to watch the flowers bloom and fall in front of the court if you are so insulted; leave the unintentional, look at the clouds and the clouds in the sky|Secretly fall in love with a person who will never fall in love with you, what he means to you: once a daydream, and later a night dream|There are always many obsessive people in this world who exchange their minds and devote their affection for the sake of a stream of clouds, a curtain of dreams, and a play.

Sometimes, being a sentimental and righteous person will be more tired than a widowed and indifferent person|I am a lonely actress, sitting in the dusk of autumn, reminiscing about the misty clouds of the past. I thought that by covering up the great door of Shaoguang, I could find my true body. In this chaotic world, I always use my tears to dress up the sadness of others. I am a cool actress, with fate in the palm of my hand, imprinted with warmth and coldness.

Although it will be scarred, no one can give the warm memory in my heart. Thank you for being in my world|Since ancient times, there have been sorrows and joys, and since ancient times, there have been sad songs.

The landscape is silent, but he remembers all the tenderness he sprinkled|Butterflies can't fly in the ocean, no one can bear to blame. This sentence seems to come from the lyrics, no matter who wrote it, many people fall in love with it. That's because life is full of too much helplessness.

Even if they are given a pair of wings, they will never fly out of the vast sea, and they will not be able to fly thousands of miles away from Pengshan|Your world will not only have black and white, bright colors are waiting for you, go ahead|Meeting you is such a beautiful thing, like hearing the wind in the forest, like the night surrounding the stars, like the summer matching watermelon, like the ocean containing blue|The most moving moments come from being remembered by friends; the most beautiful moments come from thinking of friends. There is no agreement, but there is a tacit understanding. The first-line network, flowing our mood; a mood, flying traces of heartfelt; a friendship, each other will always be treasured in my heart|From the beginning of a play to the end of a play, in the play, no one is the protagonist, everyone is the protagonist.

When the dust is over, there is really nothing to grieve|People like sunshine, things like sunshine, love like sunshine, compassion like sunshine are everywhere in the world|Because you are too enthusiastic about people, you always feel that others are indifferent to you.

Under those quiet windows, how many new stories will be repeated, gentle and sad|Time is locked in a hurry, memories are happy and melancholy gentle, and the lingering love has been written into the melody of the heart|Just remember some of the past; some memories, put them away, and the passing years, I just want to face the sea and spring flowers|But love and hate are like smoke after all, life is too short, so why bear too much. The past affairs are like a falling flower and rain. After the brilliant possession, if you can be clean and forget, it is not a kind of transparency. All visits are made by guests, and the gathering and dispersal are always the same.

Those beautiful feelings that are quiet in the bones will not change much after tens of thousands of years|Sometimes, the strongest people in the morning are those who cry and fall asleep at night|I wade into the wilderness and the jungle, you punted me across, into the sea of ??brilliant flowers|I can't tell you how much courage I have been given by those powers that were just made up by imagination in my duckweed years|Yesterday has passed, and it is still a sunny day when a new page is opened|Life is a dream, and we are those dream-seeking people, drifting on a thousand-year-old river and seeing the scenery of flowing water and falling flowers. One day, the old man had nowhere to rely, so he returned in a rowing boat, returned to his old house in the water town, drank a few cups of new tea, and watched an old show. Time passed like this, very good|If you give me a hosta, I will grow your hair for you. After all the lead is washed away, from now on, the sun will go to the end of the world. Don't be surprised, watch the flowers bloom and fall in front of the court; leave unintentionally, look at the sky and the clouds|A life, one way, one person to walk, one person to realize|Don't trust others too much, even your shadow will leave you in the dark|What is love? Love is an unexpected encounter in a vast sea of ??people, the open window in the lights of thousands of families, and the bodhi tree in the dense forest. The path of cultivation is not like waving a sword flower, but like a flat quatrain, with a beautiful artistic conception, ups and downs|If you avoid detours, you will miss the scenery. In any case, thank you for the experience|The flower matter has passed, and I missed the flowering period for no reason in the rush of time. I always think that the scattered fragrance is the circulation of love and the most beautiful inscription to Huanian. Until the eyebrows, there was no trace of youth. Only then did I realize that many pure graces in the past have been returned to Streamer. Is everyone going to the end, sweeping away the dust, will lead their lives to nothing? Maybe then, we will be able to get Enron in the turbulent crowd|Independent river bank, the clothes list does not feel cold, in the light of the evening breeze, sorrow shimmers on the river surface|The most lonely dusk hides the brightness of the sun. It is said that there is no dust in autumn water and no heart in autumn clouds. This season of the mountains and rivers should be quiet and speechless. Qiuhe is still there, but it's full of beauty. And we don't have to insist on cleaning up the ruined scenery, because time still flows proudly. Always believe that all things exist with a mission, regardless of the ups and downs, they have their own vigor. Given the fact that there are definite numbers in the world, we should live calmly and live in harmony with the mountains and rivers|Life is like a dandelion, seemingly free, but involuntary. Some things are not careless, but what you can do if you care, just do your best|In the vast sea of ??people, every day we are interpreting or watching the ending of the story of joy and sorrow, and every day we are repeating encounters and separations. Different people come and go in our lives, we will all have different feelings. The only thing in common is the warm touch when we met, the reluctant nostalgia when we parted|Don't turn the past page if you can. If you turn over the dust, your eyes will be lost|A flower from the other shore blooms in glitz for you, whether it can bloom this beautiful glitz for you|I hope you are the air flowing in the sun, flying in my chest; I hope you are the sun pouring in the air, winding me with the warmth of the autumn wind; I hope you are the maple leaves dancing with the wind, pan Bringing the red light to the scenery of late autumn; I hope you are the endless white clouds in the sky, and you can see you when you open your eyes and look up at the sky|You are the cold beer in summer, and you are the wind blowing through the skirt before the shower|You are still you, I am still me, but time has faded away from you and me, and years have fettered the ripples, and neither are you nor me. Not every relationship has a good ending. Not every woman has that He Yichen who has been waiting for her for seven years. I just wish you peace and happiness.
